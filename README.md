# app-pomodoro
A simple pomodoro timer app, aiming to be easy to read, and nice looking.
Vue.js and PWA service/web workers are used to make it a more useful offline app.

## Goals
The aim was to have a simple easy to use UI and great simplified UX experience. BEsides the timer read out I wanted a easy to glance at progress indicator. I think the background reverse is a great way to achieve this.
